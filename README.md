#### README for `dissfunctions.py`

---

### Overview

The `dissfunction.py` script is a utility for analyzing a Python codebase to identify functions that are defined but never called. This can help developers clean up their code by removing unused or "dead" code, which can improve readability and maintainability.

### Features

- **Analyzes Python Scripts**: Traverses specified directories to find unused functions in Python files.
- **Ignores Specific Paths**: Automatically skips any directories or files located within paths containing `env`, which is useful for ignoring virtual environments.
- **Reports Unused Functions**: Outputs the file path and names of any unused functions found within the codebase.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages are required beyond the standard library.

### Usage

1. **Clone or Download** the script to your local machine.

2. **Navigate** to the directory containing the script using your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Run the Script** by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python dissfunction.py
   ```

4. **Input the Directory Path**: When prompted, enter the path to the directory containing your Python project.

5. **View Results**: The script will analyze the files and output any unused functions it identifies, excluding any within `env` directories.

### Example Output

```
Enter the directory path of the Python project: <project_path>
Unused functions found:
<project_path>>/module1.py: unused_function1, unused_function2
<project_path>>/module2.py: unused_function3
```

### Customization

- **Path Ignoring**: The script is currently set to ignore paths containing `env`. You can modify this by changing the condition in the script if you have a different pattern you wish to ignore.
